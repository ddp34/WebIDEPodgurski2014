The system will allow users to collaborate in real-time
on writing code for software development.
It will have many of the functions of a IDE while having
the additional benefits of being accessible through a web browser
and having changes made by one user immediately visible to other users.
The ultimate goal of the design is to create a tool which will allow teams
to follow the development process from project initialization through
the creation of a final project build.
